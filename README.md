# Order-Anything
There are many use cases when people need to get something urgently, without wanting to do things themselves - like getting vegetables from the local market to forgetting your laptop charger at home. Starbucks doesnâ€™t deliver, but wouldn't it be nice if someone could grab your fav drink from there!

This API solves the very same problem. It lets customers sign up using their phone no, and order almost anything (From our catalogue), the order is assigned to a delivery person by admin, where he can see order details, and delivery person can update its status
